// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a 
    definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfReq = "When developers look at what is required to reach the desired outcome. What risks are involved and what methods could be put in place? What is required by the customer or market we are deisgning for?"
const design = "This and the previous step overlap slighty in objective. Developers ask what features will be created, graphics, architecture, and security measures."
const implement = "The building starts! Tranlslating the designs into code and creating the first version of the project."
const testAndInt = "Engineers test for bugs and see if their current product still aligns with the objective of the project."
const maintain = "Developers may add new features, fix bugs and security, and make sure it/'s running smoothly. And voila!!!"
